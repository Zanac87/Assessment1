									<p>Few personality types are as charming and attractive as Entrepreneurs. Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, Entrepreneurs are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. Entrepreneurs’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</p>
									<p>Yet Entrepreneurs can be easily tripped up in situations where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, Entrepreneurs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

							<h2>Learning Style</h2>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/Learning_Style_Test.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>You are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
									<br><p>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>
									<p>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:</p>
									<ul><li>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)</li>
									<li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
									<li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>
									<li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</li>
									<li>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.</li>
									<li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</li>
									<li>Color code things.</li>
									<li>Avoid distractions during study times.</li></ul>
									<p>Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>

							<h2>Emotional Intelligence Test</h2>

									<p>Not bad. Your score means you're better than the average at reading expressions. And research suggests that people can improve their emotion recognition skills with practice.</p>

							<h3>What do the test results mean for me?</h3>
									<p>I’m really not surprised at the ‘ESTP’ result in the Myers-Briggs test, I know exactly what type of person I am, how I feel and how I interact with other people. It explains a lot actually, like why I was never very good in school, always getting distracted by the social aspect rather than paying attention the way I was supposed to.
									I’m also not that surprised to learn that I am a ‘Visual’ style learner, I’ve never been very good at being given written text, told to read and absorb it then replicate it. I suppose this whole online learning thing is going to be quite the challenge because of my learning style.
									As for the Emotional Intelligence test, I expected a higher score as I’m most excellent at reading people’s expressions and their intent without them having to say a word.</p>
									<h3>How do I think these results may influence behaviour in a team?</h3>
									<p>It’ll be very interesting to see just how people with different personality types get along in their teams. A mix of personality types should function fine, as each person can facilitate a different role in their teams however, because I live for the drama, I would love to see how a team with all Alpha type personalities would function. What’s the saying? Too many chief’s, not enough Indians? Yeah, that would be a hot mess I can’t wait to see.</p>
									<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
									While my test results have said I like to be a leader and be in charge, I’m more than happy to sit back and let someone else take the reins. Having never studied or organised a study group, I’m fairly insecure about my ability to administer the appropriate actions required to manage a group of people on a project. It’ll go down like this: I’ll hang back from leading a team until I get a feel for how it works and then may take the reins once I get confident enough to be able to manage things more efficiently. There’s nothing I hate more than inefficiency and mismanagement of resources. I’m not saying I’ll know how to do it better but give me some time to suss out the situation and I should be able to identify areas for improvement.</p>
