							<h1 class="major">Interests</h1>
							<p>Ever since my parents were coerced into buying me my first computer, I’ve been fascinated with IT. From tweaking wallpaper settings to configuring secret dial up internet connections using my friend’s spare login credentials, it was a whole new world to explore.</p>
							<p>Being connected to the internet is what first allowed me to join and connect with online communities full of young people just like me.</p>
							<p>While <b>“ASL?”</b> and <b>“Wanna Cyber?”</b> didn’t evolve with the times, my interest and enjoyment for IT did. I completed a Cert 2 in IT while I was at school and even did multiple work experience stints at IT related jobs, one being a computer repair store and the other at a Navy base, specialising in the technical division.</p>
							<p>After leaving school, all of my jobs have involved IT in some capacity. Point of Sale technology when I worked at Vodafone, Allphones and Telstra, and back end application  configuration when I worked at UBank and 1-Stop Connections.</p>
							<p>1-Stop was really where my interest in IT expanded, they’re a solution provider (software company) in the freight and logistics industry. I was part of their Service Desk team and dealt with troubleshooting and high level incident reporting, I got really curious as to how everything behind the curtain worked and even looked into on the job training courses I could do to expand my knowledge.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, I relocated to Canberra and started in a role doing basic data entry and admin for a government service provider, a role that used IT but would never be a stepping stone for anything more than what it was.</p>
							<p>My current role is back in the field, I'm working as a Senior Service Desk Technician for a company contracted by the Department of Defence.
							<p><u>That journey has lead me to RMIT and studying this course.</U></p>
							<p>Working full time and requiring nice things means my only study options are to do things part time and having never seriously studied before I thought I’d test the waters out and enrol in the 2 prerequisite courses required for a Batchelor of IT, this course and Introduction to Programming.</p>
							<p>I’m hoping that I learn real world skills that I can actually take into any of my future jobs.</p>

							<span class="image right"><img src="images/IdealJob1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39730849">Cyber Security Analyst</a>
							<p>To me, the role sounds like I would be the security point of contact for the entire business. Whether someone is looking at implementing a new product change and I would have to assess the security risk involved with its implementation or if there were security incidents which needed to be investigated, I would be the person responsible for running the reports.
							I like the idea of investigating security incidents, I’m a bit of a busy body when it comes to wanting to know things, so I think I would be perfect for that aspect of the role.</p>
							<p>The job advertisement is exceptionally vague when it comes to the formal qualification requirements of the role but basically if my skill set has been sharpened enough by my previous roles and I seem like a good fit for the team, then I’m in! 
							It’s probably going to be a long journey for me to gather enough experience to be able to fulfil the skill requirements of the role, as I’ve had experience in an IT environment but nothing to do with cyber security. I’ve worked in two Service Desks, one for a software company and one for the Department of Defence, and while I’d had to deal with basic security procedures I’m nowhere near ready to take on a role like this.</p>
							<p>In order to prepare for a role like this, I would first need to finish this Batchelor of IT, possibly look into doing post graduate studies relating to cyber security, as well as gain the necessary experience working my way up through IT companies.</p>

							<h2>Myer-Briggs</h2>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Myer_Briggs_Test.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Few personality types are as charming and attractive as Entrepreneurs. Known for their ability to improvise and focus completely on the present, Entrepreneurs are great at finding exciting new things to explore and experience. Entrepreneurs’ creativity and down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth.</p>
									<p>Yet Entrepreneurs can be easily tripped up in situations where their focus on practical matters is more of a liability than an asset. Whether it is finding (or keeping) a partner, reaching dazzling heights on the career ladder, or learning to plan ahead, Entrepreneurs need to put in a conscious effort to develop their weaker traits and additional skills.</p>

							<h2>Learning Style</h2>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/Learning_Style_Test.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>You are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.</p>
									<br><p>As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to colour and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.</p>
									<p>Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:</p>
									<ul><li>Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)</li>
									<li>Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.</li>
									<li>Use flashcards to learn new words.</li>
									<li>Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.</li>
									<li>Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.</li>
									<li>Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.</li>
									<li>Color code things.</li>
									<li>Avoid distractions during study times.</li></ul>
									<p>Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.</p>

							<h2>Emotional Intelligence Test</h2>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/Emotional_Intelligence_Test.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Not bad. Your score means you're better than the average at reading expressions. And research suggests that people can improve their emotion recognition skills with practice.</p>

									</ul>
									<h3>What do the test results mean for me?</h3>
									<p>I’m really not surprised at the ‘ESTP’ result in the Myers-Briggs test, I know exactly what type of person I am, how I feel and how I interact with other people. It explains a lot actually, like why I was never very good in school, always getting distracted by the social aspect rather than paying attention the way I was supposed to.
									I’m also not that surprised to learn that I am a ‘Visual’ style learner, I’ve never been very good at being given written text, told to read and absorb it then replicate it. I suppose this whole online learning thing is going to be quite the challenge because of my learning style.
									As for the Emotional Intelligence test, I expected a higher score as I’m most excellent at reading people’s expressions and their intent without them having to say a word.</p>
									<h3>How do I think these results may influence behaviour in a team?</h3>
									<p>It’ll be very interesting to see just how people with different personality types get along in their teams. A mix of personality types should function fine, as each person can facilitate a different role in their teams however, because I live for the drama, I would love to see how a team with all Alpha type personalities would function. What’s the saying? Too many chief’s, not enough Indians? Yeah, that would be a hot mess I can’t wait to see.</p>
									<h3>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
									While my test results have said I like to be a leader and be in charge, I’m more than happy to sit back and let someone else take the reins. Having never studied or organised a study group, I’m fairly insecure about my ability to administer the appropriate actions required to manage a group of people on a project. It’ll go down like this: I’ll hang back from leading a team until I get a feel for how it works and then may take the reins once I get confident enough to be able to manage things more efficiently. There’s nothing I hate more than inefficiency and mismanagement of resources. I’m not saying I’ll know how to do it better but give me some time to suss out the situation and I should be able to identify areas for improvement.</p>

							<h1 class="major">Project Idea</h1>
							<span class="image right"><img src="images/Sniffing.GIF" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>My idea for a project is to create a mobile app called “Whoever smelt it, dealt it” that can be used to identify scents, think Shazam but for colognes, perfumes and anything else which produces a detectable odour.
Digital scent technology is currently only available in handheld form however with a bit of research and the assistance of some switched on engineers, it should be able to be shrunk down enough to fit inside a mobile phone, as just another additional sensor. Everything else is getting smaller these days, so why not a portable odour detector?
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<p>Social anxiety is a real and crippling thing, so anything that can help alleviate that level of unnecessary stress can only be a good thing.
Have you ever found yourself walking through a bar or club and have a stranger cross your path, only to have your train of thought obliterated by the tantalising aroma wafting off your drive-by scent assassin?
Some people might be too shy to come right out and ask them what scent they’re wearing but with “Whoever smelt it, dealt it” you could avoid any unnecessary social anxiety and satisfy your curiosity without approaching a stranger.</p>
<h3>Product Features:</h3>
<ol><li>“Whoever smelt it, dealt it” uses an odour sensor built into your smart phone to detect the brand and individual fragrance of the cologne or perfume that is in the user’s immediate vicinity.</li>
<li>“Whoever smelt it, dealt it” can also be used as a detector for locating unsavoury smells, for example if an animal has perished in your home, you can use the app to pinpoint its exact location.</li>
<li>If the user is allergic to a specific chemical, it can be used to alert the user of a possible allergic reaction.</li>
<li>After each detection, “Whoever smelt it, dealt it” will prompt the user to rate the scent and over time will be able to suggest similar scents based on comparable chemical compositions.</li>
<li>“Whoever smelt it, dealt it” can also be linked to social media, so the user can share their discoveries and see which scents their friends have also recently identified.</li>
<li>There will also be a comprehensive privacy settings so the user can control what information is shared on their social media, for example it can be set to auto share when they detect one of their favour brands but will not auto share if it detects an unsavoury odour.</li>
<li>The user will  be able to set up a ‘home’ location and whenever their GPS signal moves away from that location, they can be reminded to apply their favourite cologne or perfume.</li>
<li>Sometimes your friends are just too nice and don’t tell you if you stink, so there will be a self-test feature that allows the user to test themselves and see if they are giving off an unsavoury smell. It will be a good safety net to reassure those socially anxious people who always worry if they smell or not.</li>
<li>Could be used by cologne and perfume companies to do market research by assessing what every day people in the streets are wearing.</li>
<li>If your smart phone is not equipped with a scent detector, there will be an aftermarket attachment available for you to purchase and connect to your smart phone. This will connect via Bluetooth and will allow the user the same access to functionality as if their smart phone was manufactured with the inbuilt odour detector.</li></ol>
<h3>Required Tech:</h3>
<p>Aryballe Technologies currently manufacture a portable universal odour detector, a patent for their technology would need to be acquired and passed onto Engineers Australia to  assist with the miniaturisation of the tech and the construction of the after-market smart phone accessory.
The smart phone app will be designed and built by me using the service provided by buildfire.com.</p>
<h3>Skills Required:</h3>
<p>Micro engineering skills will definitely be required as far as developing a functioning smart phone sensor, as well as the aftermarket accessory.
Programming language skills will also be required when it comes to the development of the smart phone app itself.
When it comes to selling the finished product, it all comes down to how well you can brand and market the product, so savvy marketing talents would also be on the list of required skills.</p>
<h3>Outcome:</h3>
<p>The ideal outcome would be to make money, so that I could retire and live comfortably at age 30(ish). 
The more likely outcome would be the successful creation of a product that will help potentially dozens of people with their social anxiety issues, in a very limited capacity.
It would also assist those trend setters, the ones who always have the have the latest and greatest of everything, stay on trend when it comes to their scent. You don’t see anyone walking around wearing Joop! Homme anymore because it’s no longer a thing.</p>					</div>
