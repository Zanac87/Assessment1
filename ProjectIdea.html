							<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>My idea for a project is to create a mobile app called “Whoever smelt it, dealt it” that can be used to identify scents, think Shazam but for colognes, perfumes and anything else which produces a detectable odour.
Digital scent technology is currently only available in handheld form however with a bit of research and the assistance of some switched on engineers, it should be able to be shrunk down enough to fit inside a mobile phone, as just another additional sensor. Everything else is getting smaller these days, so why not a portable odour detector?
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
<p>Social anxiety is a real and crippling thing, so anything that can help alleviate that level of unnecessary stress can only be a good thing.
Have you ever found yourself walking through a bar or club and have a stranger cross your path, only to have your train of thought obliterated by the tantalising aroma wafting off your drive-by scent assassin?
Some people might be too shy to come right out and ask them what scent they’re wearing but with “Whoever smelt it, dealt it” you could avoid any unnecessary social anxiety and satisfy your curiosity without approaching a stranger.</p>
<h3>Product Features:</h3>
<ol><li>“Whoever smelt it, dealt it” uses an odour sensor built into your smart phone to detect the brand and individual fragrance of the cologne or perfume that is in the user’s immediate vicinity.</li>
<li>“Whoever smelt it, dealt it” can also be used as a detector for locating unsavoury smells, for example if an animal has perished in your home, you can use the app to pinpoint its exact location.</li>
<li>If the user is allergic to a specific chemical, it can be used to alert the user of a possible allergic reaction.</li>
<li>After each detection, “Whoever smelt it, dealt it” will prompt the user to rate the scent and over time will be able to suggest similar scents based on comparable chemical compositions.</li>
<li>“Whoever smelt it, dealt it” can also be linked to social media, so the user can share their discoveries and see which scents their friends have also recently identified.</li>
<li>There will also be a comprehensive privacy settings so the user can control what information is shared on their social media, for example it can be set to auto share when they detect one of their favour brands but will not auto share if it detects an unsavoury odour.</li>
<li>The user will  be able to set up a ‘home’ location and whenever their GPS signal moves away from that location, they can be reminded to apply their favourite cologne or perfume.</li>
<li>Sometimes your friends are just too nice and don’t tell you if you stink, so there will be a self-test feature that allows the user to test themselves and see if they are giving off an unsavoury smell. It will be a good safety net to reassure those socially anxious people who always worry if they smell or not.</li>
<li>Could be used by cologne and perfume companies to do market research by assessing what every day people in the streets are wearing.</li>
<li>If your smart phone is not equipped with a scent detector, there will be an aftermarket attachment available for you to purchase and connect to your smart phone. This will connect via Bluetooth and will allow the user the same access to functionality as if their smart phone was manufactured with the inbuilt odour detector.</li></ol>
<h3>Required Tech:</h3>
<p>Aryballe Technologies currently manufacture a portable universal odour detector, a patent for their technology would need to be acquired and passed onto Engineers Australia to  assist with the miniaturisation of the tech and the construction of the after-market smart phone accessory.
The smart phone app will be designed and built by me using the service provided by buildfire.com.</p>
<h3>Skills Required:</h3>
<p>Micro engineering skills will definitely be required as far as developing a functioning smart phone sensor, as well as the aftermarket accessory.
Programming language skills will also be required when it comes to the development of the smart phone app itself.
When it comes to selling the finished product, it all comes down to how well you can brand and market the product, so savvy marketing talents would also be on the list of required skills.</p>
<h3>Outcome:</h3>
<p>The ideal outcome would be to make money, so that I could retire and live comfortably at age 30(ish). 
The more likely outcome would be the successful creation of a product that will help potentially dozens of people with their social anxiety issues, in a very limited capacity.
It would also assist those trend setters, the ones who always have the have the latest and greatest of everything, stay on trend when it comes to their scent. You don’t see anyone walking around wearing Joop! Homme anymore because it’s no longer a thing.</p>					</div>
