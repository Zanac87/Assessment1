							<p>Ever since my parents were coerced into buying me my first computer, I’ve been fascinated with IT. From tweaking wallpaper settings to configuring secret dial up internet connections using my friend’s spare login credentials, it was a whole new world to explore.</p>
							<p>Being connected to the internet is what first allowed me to join and connect with online communities full of young people just like me.</p>
							<p>While <b>“ASL?”</b> and <b>“Wanna Cyber?”</b> didn’t evolve with the times, my interest and enjoyment for IT did. I completed a Cert 2 in IT while I was at school and even did multiple work experience stints at IT related jobs, one being a computer repair store and the other at a Navy base, specialising in the technical division.</p>
							<p>After leaving school, all of my jobs have involved IT in some capacity. Point of Sale technology when I worked at Vodafone, Allphones and Telstra, and back end application  configuration when I worked at UBank and 1-Stop Connections.</p>
							<p>1-Stop was really where my interest in IT expanded, they’re a solution provider (software company) in the freight and logistics industry. I was part of their Service Desk team and dealt with troubleshooting and high level incident reporting, I got really curious as to how everything behind the curtain worked and even looked into on the job training courses I could do to expand my knowledge.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, I relocated to Canberra and started in a role doing basic data entry and admin for a government service provider, a role that used IT but would never be a stepping stone for anything more than what it was.</p>
							<p>My current role is back in the field, I'm working as a Senior Service Desk Technician for a company contracted by the Department of Defence.
							<p><u>That journey has lead me to RMIT and studying this course.</U></p>
							<p>Working full time and requiring nice things means my only study options are to do things part time and having never seriously studied before I thought I’d test the waters out and enrol in the 2 prerequisite courses required for a Batchelor of IT, this course and Introduction to Programming.</p>
							<p>I’m hoping that I learn real world skills that I can actually take into any of my future jobs.</p>
